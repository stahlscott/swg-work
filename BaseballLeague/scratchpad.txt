Thoughts - 

Simplifying:
	Instead of team containing hashmap of players, why not have the leagueroster be a hashmap of PlayerID / TeamName ? Force TeamName to be unique

Req 1: Instead of just "playerId", we have two separate index Ids, one for player, one for team. Team starts at 1, player starts at 100,000.

_K____|____V__
	1 | Tigers
	2 | Indians
	3 | Mets
100001| Tigers
100002| Tigers
100003| Indians
100004| Mets
100005| Indians
	4 | Yankees

Key is req #2: player must be associated with team. So Player is the Key, TeamName is the value. Maybe Team contains an ArrayList of all players assoc with it.

Req 3 -> search leagueRoster.values for team name, add to array if not already in array

Req 4 -> getTeamFromUser, then do a fore loop on the leagueRoster keySet and if the value matches the given string, add to ArrayList 

Req 5 -> much easier, just getPlayerFromUser, then change leagueRoster.get(playerId) => new teamName and Player.teamName to new teamName
