#Baseball Roster Manager

This console program was written as extra credit during our week focusing on CRUDs writen with n-tier design, Lists, and Maps. It manages several teams and players, storing the information in an external text file. Not much in the way of extra challenge here on the project aside from the volume of work - our pair was the only one in class that actually got to this project after the three other similar CRUDs we wrote the same week.
