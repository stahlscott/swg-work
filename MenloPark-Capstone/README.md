Content Management System - Capstone project

Our assignment was to build a content management system from scratch, utilizing SpringMVC, SQL, Java, JavaScript and Agile methodologies. This is our capstone project pulling together our work over the past 10 weeks.

I designed the database, wrote the entire DAO, wrote 80% of the unit tests, and contributed significantly on the front end. Ask and I will be more specific!
