Content Management System - Capstone project

Our assignment was to build a content management system from scratch, utilizing SpringMVC, SQL, Java, and JavaScript. This is our capstone project pulling together our work over the past 10 weeks. I designed the database, wrote the DAO and 80% of the unit tests, and contributed significantly on the front end.
