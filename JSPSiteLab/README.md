# JSPSiteLab

This is a web app representing my work learning servlets, jsp, and jstl through refactoring some of our previous labs (Lucky Sevens, Factorizor, Interest Calculator) and writing some new ones while presenting the results using Bootstrap. I tried to make it more challenging by:
1) incorporating when/otherwise statements to make the start and response pages land on the same jsp page
2) templating the navbar and using jstl to determine which tab should be active
3) making the Unit Converter dynamic using JS
